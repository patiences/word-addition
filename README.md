You must be using Intermediate Student with lambda or Advanced Student to run the program. 

To solve P1 (ON+ON+ON=GO), run the program and type in (solve P1 empty). 
Solve your own puzzles from scratch by running (solve YOUR_PROBLEM empty). 
See lines 14, 17 for how to format the problem. 
You can also choose to solve a problem with a partial solution (ie a non-empty dictionary).
